\title{Measure an impact of the covariates on the response using MC+.
This function evaluates the MC+ coefficients regressing \code{y} onto the design matrix \code{x} over subsamples in \code{subsamples}.}
\usage{
mcplus.coef(x, y, subsamples, nonzero = NULL, family = c("gaussian",
  "binomial"), alpha = 1, gamma = 3, maxit = 500, tol = 0.01,
  lambda.ratio = 1e-06, nlam = 25, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix with \code{n} observations of \code{p} covariates in each row.}

\item{y}{Response vector with \code{n} observations.}

\item{subsamples}{Matrix with \code{m} indices of \code{N} subsamples in each column.}

\item{nonzero}{Number of non-zero coefficients estimated for each subsample.}

\item{family}{Determines the likelihood optimised in the estimation procedure.}

\item{alpha}{Scalar between 0 and 1 determining l2 penalty (see details).}

\item{gamma}{Scalar greater than 1. The concacivity parameter (see details).}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of itarations when computing the MC+ coefficients.}

\item{tol}{Scalar determining convergence of the MC+ algorithm used.}

\item{lambda.ratio}{Scalar being a fraction of 1. Used in the MC+ algorithm}

\item{nlam}{Number of penalty parameters used in the MC+ algorithm.}

\item{...}{Not in use.}
}
\details{
To solve the MC+ problem, we implement the coordinate descent algorithm as in Breheny Jian (2011).
